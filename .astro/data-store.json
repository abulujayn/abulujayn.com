I ensure you, that is neither a mistake nor am I writing from the past but rather, I am simply just using a different dating system. There are actually quite a lot of different dating systems and if you're interested, I highly recommend just reading about some of the ones listed on \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia\u003C/a>. As for the dating system or calendar that I'm using, that would be the Hijri calendar. It's a lunar-based calendar with 12 months, each with 29 or 30 days (dependent upon the visibility of the moon) which begun after a major event in Islāmic history, more specifically in the life of prophet Muḥammad ﷺ.\n\nToday is \u003CHijriNow />, which corresponds to \u003CDateNow /> Gregorian.

My plan for this place is to share my random, sometimes formulated thoughts, ideas and opinions on any topic which I have an interest or passion in; I'll likely also be putting out guides/tutorials for things which I feel are either not covered enough or just not in a way that I personally found easy to understand/follow._\n\nBack in the days when I first discovered the fascinating \"inspect element\" button when I was still in the early days of high school, my classmates and I would laugh at our silly jokes we made when we \"hacked\" Google, Wikipedia and other sites to make it say or show exactly what we wanted. Those very moments and especially the fact that my creations/modifications did not survive past a simple webpage reload led to the spark inside me to pursue website creation. I intentionally call it _creation_ and not _development_.\n\nThis journey began with the very rudimentary process of using a WYSIWYG editor namely Weebly and Wix. Around that time, some of my classmates and I started playing this MMORPG in which we made a clan/group/party so we decided to create a website for it which until now I thought was lost to time but surprisingly I've managed to find \u003Ca href=\"https://oncothelegion.weebly.com\" target=\"_blank\">it\u003C/a>! Pretty early on, I also figured out that I can embed custom HTML onto these pages meaning I wasn't just limited to the elements and controls that the editor(s) provided - in the beginning, it was merely copy-pasting but as I gradually learnt the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript through Codecademy and experiementing, I eventually started to understand how much I could really achieve with pure code. As I explored the HTML embedded elements more, I began to feel restricted by the bounds of a WYSIWYG editor especially one where you can't view the entire source of the webpage - this led to me creating websites from scratch.\n\nTo not make this drag on too long, I'll cut the story short: I eventually got to a stage where I felt comfortable making what I wanted to make from scratch in HTML, CSS and Javascript - although I should preface it with the fact that I just can't come up with good designs and I blame that on my creativity. Since then, I've had the urge to create my own personal website - in the beginning, merely just to have a presence online but as I matured it turned into wanting to create my own blog to share my thoughts and help to whoever wanted to entertain it.\n\nWith this newfound desire to create my own site, I went through many _many_ attempts and iterations (a lot of which can be found on my \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/abulujayn\" target=\"_blank\">github\u003C/a>) which consisted of trying from scratch to using templates built/running off frameworks/platforms. For some reason, I was either unable to complete or unsatisfied with the result of all my attempts for the main three reasons of: lack of motivation, didn't like the design, or the design didn't feel like it was _mine_. The bottleneck always had to do with _design_. So, after (probably) more than a decade, I have finally succeeded in my goal by ditching design (in the modern sense) altogether. Where did I come up with this enlightening idea? Mostly through seeing a fair few websites utilise this principle found on Hacker News, and also the fact that I'm just a really big fan of simplicity and minimalism. This had been brewing inside me for some time but the thing that really tipped me over the edge was reading this article about how one developer refused to use modern git platforms and instead stuck to the legacy of way of people raising \"pull requests\" by manually contacting the developer. I found the article on Hacker News, but I out of my lack of foresight, forgot to save a link to it for future reference. If I do find it in the future though, I'll be sure to link to it here. I considered myself someone free of the shackles of most societal norms and expectations but reading that article really opened my mind and eyes to the fact that sometimes we are tied down by shackles we don't even realise are there in the first place. Another thing that happened quite recently that pushed me in this direction is I stumbled upon \u003Ca href=\"https://1mb.club\" target=\"_blank\">1mb.club\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://nocss.club\" target=\"_blank\">nocss.club\u003C/a> which I will most likely be applying to very soon.\n\nNow, with the background of this website out of the way. My plan for this place is to share my random, sometimes formulated thoughts, ideas and opinions on any topic which I have an interest or passion in; I'll likely also be putting out guides/tutorials for things which I feel are either not covered enough or just not in a way that I personally found easy to understand/follow.","src/content/post/finally-a-beginning/index.mdx","360909a0fb4e46e8","finally-a-beginning/index.mdx","just-ship-it",{"id":37,"data":39,"body":53,"filePath":54,"digest":55,"legacyId":56,"deferredRender":26},{"title":40,"date":41,"tags":42,"using":19,"meta":47},"just ship it",["Date","2026-01-02T00:00:00.000Z"],[17,43,44,45,46],"ai","vibecoding","github copilot","gemini",[48,49,50,51,52],"gemini cli","google gemini","ai coding","vibe coding","vs code copilot","بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم\n\nOne problem I've always had with working on my side-projects is I'd never be able to get the ball moving on developing it. I'd get an idea one day, think about it (a lot) for a week and maybe even talk to ChatGPT about it. Sometimes, I (or ChatGPT) might actually write up a plan for it and sometimes I even make it to the stage of creating a plan/task list. Once I had gotten enough excitement built up for the idea, I may even create a project and do a couple things; that's usually where it ended. My theory is that I struggled to get over the first hurdle of starting a project just because of there being a big gap from starting to actually having something substantial to look at.\n\nEnter vibecoding. It's now 2026 and AI has come a long way, especially in the sphere of programming/vibecoding. My first experience using AI coding tools, which was with Github Copilot in VS Code was... okay. It was definitely able to do things, but I didn't exactly find it the most impressive nor efficient. Even with vibecoding, I was still failing at really getting a project rolling. Fast-forward to me trying out Gemini CLI, vibecoding is definitely much more efficient than it used to be and I finally have confidence in getting projects rolling. I actually did get \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/abulujayn/ssh-tui\" target=\"_blank\">one project\u003C/a> completed before leaving Copilot for Gemini. After using Gemini for a few days now and getting used to it, I've completed another project! Probably the fastest ever I've been able to complete a project since my Bukkit and Discord bot days.\n\nI present to you, \u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/abulujayn/thisshouldbeathing\" target=\"_blank\">this should be a thing\u003C/a>. Yes, it's extremely simple and not that impressive *but* it's a project I've actually managed to publish online.\n\nAfter this little success of mine, I hope to ship more of my random ideas into actual solutions. Next, I'll be working on that text-based space exploration rpg that's been brewing in my mind the past couple of months إن شاء الله. I guess I can finally start updating my [projects](/projects) page.

The Debian-based distros are great for community, support and stability but are really far behind on versions of tools and softwares. Alpine lacks that community and support but if you're using edge, then software/tools are generally quite up-to-date; there is also the occasional compatibility issue with Alpine due to musl. These slight drawbacks led me to research what other people are choosing as their daily driver distro and a common occurence was: Fedora. Although I had dabbled with a bunch of other distros such as Arch, Kali and CentOS (this was actually my introduction to Linux), I had never actually tried Fedora because ever since leaving CentOS I've kind strayed away from Red Hat and thought that any of the Red Hat distros would be very much akin to CentOS. What I was reading about Fedora, made a lot of sense and appealed to me so I decided to give it a go. I spun up a Fedora 42 Workstation VM in VMWare Fusion on my MBP, because unfortunately I just don't have any computers which would be well-supported by Linux; although I'm planning to fix that with my next laptop إن شاء الله.\n\nAfter about a weeks use, I was sold. Tools and third-party software being up-to-date was/is a breeze of fresh air after working with Ubuntu for so long. DNF is great, and honestly not all too different from APT - in fact, I think I might even find it easier to use. So, I had decided that Fedora would be the distro I run on my next daily driver since it wasn't exactly feasible to run it through a VM all the time and none of the computers I had would support it well enough to use as the primary OS - or so I thought.\n\nI have known about Asahi Linux for a while, but to my knowledge it was still very experimental and finicky - not quite ready for regular use but that's when as I was researching what my next laptop should be, I saw people claiming that they run Linux on their Apple Silicon Macs. That led me to check the current compatibility of [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org/fedora/#device-support) and to my surprise, it's actually very useable - sure, there's a lot of hardware which will be deemed useless under it but enough of the hardware is supported to actually daily drive it.\n\nThat's what leads us here, my first post written on Fedora running off of my M1 Pro MBP. It is still day 1, so I may post about this again in the future either after long-term use or after having to return back to macOS (until I get my next laptop).\n\nOh, also, since moving to Fedora, I've been exposed to Podman which I'll be attempting to move to from Docker because: rootless containers!

My first impressions were quite good, Asahi is actually surprisingly very functional and definitely useable. After some time however, I've decided to stop using Asahi because of one main issue: battery life. The performance of the battery life on Asahi both whilst in sleep or in use just doesn't even come close to the performance on macOS. As a result of this flaw, I've decided to move back to macOS on my mac.\n\nAlthough it's possible to run Fedora/Linux on the devices I currently have, they weren't exactly built with Linux in mind and thus do have some driver/compatibility issues which aren't the end of the world but I guess they're annoying enough for me to be willing to put up with non-Linux. \n\nWith my current workflow/computer usage, I have yet to come across a software compatibility issue which would have been solved by running Linux. I'm sure there are people out there whose workflows absolutely require Linux, and they'd probably be willing to deal with the compatibility/support drawbacks but I'm not one of them at this stage.
