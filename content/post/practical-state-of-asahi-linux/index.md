About two and half months ago, I installed Fedora onto my mac via Asahi Linux. My first impressions were quite good, Asahi is actually surprisingly very functional and definitely useable. After some time however, I've decided to stop using Asahi because of one main issue: battery life. The performance of the battery life on Asahi both whilst in sleep or in use just doesn't even come close to the performance on macOS. As a result of this flaw, I've decided to move back to macOS on my mac.

Although it's possible to run Fedora/Linux on the devices I currently have, they weren't exactly built with Linux in mind and thus do have some driver/compatibility issues which aren't the end of the world but I guess they're annoying enough for me to be willing to put up with non-Linux. 

With my current workflow/computer usage, I have yet to come across a software compatibility issue which would have been solved by running Linux. I'm sure there are people out there whose workflows absolutely require Linux, and they'd probably be willing to deal with the compatibility/support drawbacks but I'm not one of them at this stage. For now, I'll be sticking with either macOS (only as long as I keep this mac) and Windows.
