<Ar term="basmalah" />

You may have noticed and been confused why my posts are dated in the 15th century. I ensure you, that is neither a mistake nor am I writing from the past but rather, I am simply just using a different dating system. There are actually quite a lot of different dating systems and if you're interested, I highly recommend just reading about some of the ones listed on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>. As for the dating system or calendar that I'm using, that would be the Hijri calendar. It's a lunar-based calendar with 12 months, each with 29 or 30 days (dependent upon the visibility of the moon) which begun after a major event in Islāmic history, more specifically in the life of prophet Muḥammad <Ar term="ṣalawāt" />.

Today is <HijriNow />, which corresponds to <DateNow /> Gregorian.
