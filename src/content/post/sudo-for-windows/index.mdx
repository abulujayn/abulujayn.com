Why is it only today that I find out Windows actually does have a [sudo function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-settings/sudo/). It's always been such a pain to open a completely new terminal window just to run *one* command as admin. The thought "Access to administrator privileges on Windows is so counter-intuitive, unlike Linux and Mac" has literally been on my mind the past few weeks but سبحان الله turns out there actually is a way to make it more intuitive الحمد لله.
